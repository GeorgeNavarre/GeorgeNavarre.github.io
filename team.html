            Phil North is an ecologist with 36 years of experience assessing the environmental impact of human activities.  He worked as a federal ecologist for 28 years.  First, he studied how the great water projects in California, that provide water for agriculture and mega-cities, might release a little of the precious liquid to allow the last few thousand salmon in the State’s rivers to continue to exist. Then he worked for the Environmental Protection Agency in Alaska, where he went to experience something in short supply in California: healthy, wild and free rivers. In Alaska he evaluated the effects of development of all kinds, including mines, small and large.  His final project was the Pebble Mine in the Bristol Bay watershed. There, all the lessons of his career came into focus.  He discovered a need to make environmental information around resource extraction efficiently and transparently available to everyone.  There was a need to hold everyone involved in the discussion accountable and keep them honest in their rhetoric.  He began a search for how to make this happen.

            Philip Murphy holds a doctorate in theoretical physics focused on cosmology.  His PhD thesis focused on how small fluctuations in the early universe give rise to the large scale structure of the universe today.    While those fluctuations in the early universe are assumed to be random, we as a society make decisions every day which coupled with trends and uncertainty constrain our futures in wickedly complex ways.   His belief that well structured simulations, despite much uncertainty,  can illuminate how decisions to take actions today can results in very different futures made the switch to environmental decision making inevitable.  A finite planet coupled with climate change requires wise decision making today if the next generation is to live in a healthy world.  He has been developing decision support software and processes for over a quarter century for fields from farming, health care, environmental recovery, dam repair, national budgeting for a federal agency, oil well design and conflict resolution.   So while information technology is key to developing the highly innovative collaborative society we need to create a resilient world, the processes to extract and refine the rare metals that computing and communications infrastructure requires can significantly add to ecosystem and human stressors.   This project pulls together all he has learnt to address this key problem.
