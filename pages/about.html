            First, and perhaps most importantly, we are assembling a
            comprehensive database of all publicly available data relating to
            extractive activities and their effects upon the surrounding
            ecological, economic, and communal surroundings.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            Of course, that then necessitates access to that data, so we are
            developing user-friendly navigation tools. No need to learn any
            programming or query languages -
            <em>if you can use a computer you can access our data!</em>
          </p>
          <p class="">
            Ask a plain English question in our natural language query tool and
            you'll be routed to all relevant information in our database,
            complete with citations and - where possible - links to the full
            source text.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            If it's a region you're interested in, you can browse the spatial
            explorer and view by municipality, ecoregion, and many other preset
            boundaries. Or you can draw your own polygons and customize your
            data that way.

            We create an ontology where everything is related in groups called
            ”triples”. A triple is a group of two "entities"- which are any
            objects represented in the ontology - and a relationship between
            them. The relationship is explicitly recorded in the ontology.

            Entities also have "classes" which they fall into, which you can
            think of as the "type" of object it is. Each class has a group of
            attributes associated with it, the fields of which will be the same
            across all members of the class, but who values may vary.

            The structure that is created when numerous entities are linked in
            this way is called a knowledge graph.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowledge graphs have certain advantages over more traditional database structures. For our purposes, the most important of these include the combinatation of disperate data sources, machine understandability, and subsequently machine inference.
          </p>
          <p>Inference is the ability to extrapolate facts that arent explicitly stated in the database, based on data and relationships that are specifically encoded. This allows us to perform more insightful queries than traditional databases.</p>

          <p>
            The data for a knowledge graph must live somewhere, and we will be hosting ours on a linked data media wiki. This lets us create templates for classes and link entities easily using markdown. This also let users easily navigate if they are at all familiar wikis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usually, knowledge graphs sacrifice human usability for machine readability. By tying our knowledge graph and Wiki so close together we can make our data machine readable yet easily accessible to any curious human.

          Currently, querying databases requires knowledge of query languages that aren't practical to learn for many users. You also have to know in detail how the specific database you're querying is organized. We are working on making it possible to simply ask the database a question in plain English and receive an accurate answer, as well as proposed paths of information you may also want to pursue.

            When you ask a plain language question, the LLM will create a corresponding query in the appropriate language so you don't have to! The database will then perform the query and provide the results to the user. It's important to note that at no point is the LLM actually presenting the user with information: it is only formulating the query. This gets around the problem with AI hallucination.

            The knowledge graph enables us to infer connections that has not been specifically added.

            At the base of much of our organization is the USEPA ecoregions. We've clicked on the Level 4 Ecoregions layer so we can see the ecological setting we're concerned with. <br \><br \> We could draw on the map to select an area, but Sesame Street is in Manhattan, so we'll apply the New York municiplalty layer on top of that.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we can see the boundaries of New York City, and in the info box at the bottom of the interface we are presented with basic information about the city. If we wished we could click on that info to navigate through to the NYC wiki page. <br \><br \>For now though we'll check out some species that live in NYC, and therfore near Oscar.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use the Layers window to navigate to species info that will let us populate the region we've selected with sightings of the species of concern. <br \><br \> It looks like there are alot of racoons in the area, but they are pretty spread out. We're looking for a creature he might see every day so lets add another selction.
          </p>
          <p>
            We figure Sunffleupagus would be a good bet, so we select the species from the Layers window. We're actualy a little surprised to see that the Snuffalupagus range is acutally a bit bigger than expected - we thought there was only one and that it lived on Sesame Street!
          </p>
          <p>
            We can click on any one of the sightings and find out more details about that particular sighting. We can also slick through to the Wiki page and discover that there are a number of Sunffleupagi, and that they all live in a cave just outside of Sesame Street.
