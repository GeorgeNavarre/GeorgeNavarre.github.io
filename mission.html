        <p>
        The purpose of EcoInfo is to make publicly available environmental, social and labor information for resource 
        extraction projects accessible to the public.  Our presentation of information will be transparent, traceable, 
        and nonadvocacy.  We will neither support nor oppose any project. Three levels of service will be provided with 
        progressively greater access to detailed information: free access to a database and search engine, subscription 
        to prepared information and updates, and fee for research and report writing.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will fulfill our purpose through a website that is a portal to environmental data and a library of public documents, as well as create software that 
        provides specialized search capability.  We will write summary reports about projects, commodities and industries.  
        We will write articles that address particular issues of interest to our users. The objectivity of information sources 
        will be rated so that users may verify the level of trust they can choose to place there. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Information Development: We have written a draft example report for the Stibnite Mine, located in Valley County, 
        Idaho.  A draft report on lithium as a commodity is dated and needs to be updated. We are starting on a report on 
        Pebble Mine.  We plan to focus on mines for the immediate future, unless a report on a commodity or industry is 
        requested.  The Stibnite and Pebble reports will be posted on the website as examples of our first and primary
         product that is available for a fee.  The data in the reports will be included in a database and concept map. 
          When this information is complete, we will open for business to prepare reports for a fee. Data collected in 
          this process will be included in the data base.  The website will be developed as products become available.
        </p>
        <p>
        Software Development: The next steps, to be completed concurrently, will be to develop the knowledge graph for 
        EcoInfo, and the search platform based on the knowledge graph.  The search platform will provide highly refined 
        search results specifically controlled by the relationships of concepts in the knowledge graph. This software 
        will accelerate our search effort and report writing. Ultimately search results can be available to the public.  
        A library of data, documents and concept maps will be searchable to provide data and some level of analysis, 
        available for free as a public service.  Project updates, blog posts and news, as well as access to all reports
         will be available for a subscription fee.  In depth reports will be available for a project specific fee.
        </p>
        <p>
        We will develop models of the relationships between environmental, social and labor data and the mine.  Model outputs
         will be inputs for the EMDS (Ecosystem Management Decision Support) platform to analyze the interaction of these data
          and the mine based on outcome indicators specified by the user. While EMDS is open source, our application of the 
          software will be licensed and supported for use by those interested in conducting their own research.
